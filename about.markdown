Hi, I'm Doug. Middle aged white guy in Perth, Western Australia. The current point of this blog is to write abut the stuff I'm working on.

I'm a husband, dad, cook, AFOL, software developer, solution architect, aspiring maker. I also like to snorkel and scuba dive, 
take photos, dance (getting back into Lindy Hop), draw, create. I usually have multiple personal projects on the go
and tend to jump from idea to idea a lot. Using things in non-standard (but logical (to me)) ways is something I take a lot 
of joy in. I also use parentheses, and parenthetical commas, too much (probably).

We have a dog, Grover (border collie x standard poodle). He has a fetch addiction, but, other than that, he's amazingly well
behaved, and his default mode is friendly. We take no credit for this, we got lucky.

## TMI
I'm a big fan of science, but I don't have the need to get a deep knowledge in many areas. I love listening to
smart science minded people talk about what their work. I'm also a skeptic in the sense of [Scientific 
Skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism). I have a particular disdain for "alternative medicine"
in particular homeopathy.

I have a severe depressive disorder and a generalized anxiety disorder, this all came to a head in 2020. After 
2 hospital stays, finding the right-for-me medication, other treatment ([ECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy) 
& [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation)) and therapy (CBT, Schema, DBT) I 
now manage my mental health actively. It's not ever going to be "cured" but it's managed. I tend to go on about it a bit.

I identify with a lot of the ADHD symptoms, but my psychiatrist doesn't think it's worth testing for as a diagnosis
wouldn't change my recommended treatment, he did test me for Autism Spectrum, the results were inconclusive. 

All this is to say, I'm a little neuro-divergent, but I get by.
